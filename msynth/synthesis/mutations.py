class Mutator:
    """
    Mutator to perform mutations on a synthesis state.

    The mutator interacts with the grammar to perform
    minor modifications to the synthesis state. It
    provides the following mutations:

    - replace subexpression with leaf
    - replace subexpression with expression
    - downcast expression

    The first two mutations are enabled by default. The mutator
    provides the functionality to enable additional mutations
    by analyzing a provided expression that represents a function
    f(x0, ..., xi).

    Mutations operate on the synthesis state by modifying its `expr_ast`
    as well as updating it replacement dictionary accordingly. At the end of
    each mutation, the synthesis state is cleaned up to avoid dead mutations.

    Enabled mutations are managed in the list `mutations`. The list `sizes_casting`
    stores sizes used in downcasting and upcasting mutations.

    Attributes:
        grammar (Grammar): Grammar to generate expressions.
        sizes_casting (List(int)): Sizes for down/upcasting mutations.
        mutations (List(Any)): List of active mutations.
